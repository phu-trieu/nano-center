Although a new (Z490) LGA1200 motherboard is required, it will remain compatible with Rocket Lake CPUs which are due later this year. The 10700K’s $400 USD price tag puts it in a similar price band to AMD’s 12-core hyperthreaded Ryzen 9 3900X, however, the 10700K’s faster cores combined with its lower memory latency, yield a 12% effective speed advantage over the 3900X. Intra-generationally comparing the 10700K and 10600K shows that the 10600K offers almost identical gaming performance for 34% less money.

Although a new Z490 (LGA1200) motherboard is required, Intel have indicated that LGA1200 will remain compatible with Rocket Lake CPUs which are due later this year. The eight-core Ryzen 3700X currently competes in the 10600K’s price bracket. CPU based encoding is akin to using hair clippers on a lawn but If dedicated hardware such as NVENC or QuickSync is not an option, the 3700X can outperform the 10600K in encoding workloads such as UserBenchmark 64-core, Cinebench, Blender-CPU and Handbrake-CPU. Meanwhile, the 10600K is better for almost everything else. Currently, the real problem with the 10600K, and much of the Comet Lake line up, is availability. Whilst there was a paper launch in Q2 2020, at the time of writing, the 10600K is still largely unavailable for purchase. In order to achieve better value for money, without compromising on gaming performance, it is necessary to consider the older generation 9600K which is 26% cheaper and offers similar gaming performance.

There are also 500 series chipset improvements including: 20 PCIe4 CPU lanes (up from 16) and USB 3.2 Gen 2x2 (20 Gbps up from 10 Gbps). Rocket Lake’s IPC uplift translates to around a 10% faster Effective Speed than both Intel's 10th Gen and AMD’s 5000 series. Despite Intel’s performance lead, AMD continues to outsell Intel. Given the scale of Intel's operation, it’s inexplicable that their marketing remains so neglected. Little effort is made to counter widespread disinformation such as: “it uses too much electricity” or the classic: “it needs more cores”. Intel’s marketing samples are routinely distributed to reviewers that appear better incentivized to bury Intel's products rather than review them. Not enabling XMP or only testing with BIOS power limits enabled is akin to leaving the handbrake on during a race. Mind-numbing “scientific” and rendering benchmarks are presented as gospel. Different games, mostly unplayed by real users, are cherry picked for each “review”. When it's convenient, canned game benchmarks are chosen such as Ulletical’s CSGO which runs at nearly double the in-game fps. Credible benchmark data, which necessarily includes replicable video footage from popular games, is the exception rather than the rule. At every release, AMD’s marketers coordinate narratives to ensure another feast of blue blubber. Nonetheless, towards the end of 2021, Intel’s Golden Cove is due to offer an additional 20-30% performance increase. At that time, with a net 30-40% performance lead, Intel will probably regain significant market share despite AMD's class-leading marketing.

Whilst AMD’s competing $420 USD Ryzen 3900X and $675 USD Ryzen 3950X do have a greater number of cores, their lower clock speeds and higher memory latency handicap them in non-rendering use cases. Overall, the 10900K has a 16% effective speed advantage over both the 3900X and 3950X. Users that do a lot of rendering should investigate dedicated hardware encoders such as NVENC and Quick Sync as these are far more efficient than CPU based rendering.
